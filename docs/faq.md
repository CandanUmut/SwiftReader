# FAQ

## Is this Spritz?

SwiftReader uses an RSVP (rapid serial visual presentation) style similar to Spritz, but it’s a standalone, privacy-first web app with its own reader and library.

## Can I read 900 WPM?

Some people can reach very high speeds, but comprehension varies by content and reader. Start slower, increase gradually, and prioritize understanding over speed.

## Does it track me?

No. SwiftReader has no analytics, no accounts, and no tracking. All data stays in your browser unless you export it.

## Does it upload my PDFs?

No. Files are processed locally in your browser. Nothing is uploaded or sent to a server.

## Why does EPUB import fail sometimes?

EPUBs are complex and vary across publishers. Some files may have unusual structures or missing metadata. If an EPUB fails:

- Try another file to confirm it’s not a general issue.
- Provide the file type and size in a bug report.
- Include console errors if possible.
